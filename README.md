# My portfolio

this is a website i created as a portfolio about me and what i like to do. there is also some of mine works that i have done during mine first sem of poly.

## Design process

##Features

for the first section of my website there are 3 button on the left side of the screen below my self intro for users to jump to the section where they would like to look at.
there is also a header with the same buttons in case user dont know which section they are at the header buttons will stay on the top of the screen the enitre time to let then use.

### Existing Features
On the first section there is also a contact me box where user can ask me any questions using the email and i will reply back to them as soon as i can.

### Features left to implement
rather then the section where i put out my personal infromations on the second page i can do like a left to right scroll to show rather then all in one page making it look very squeezey and also the box for the contact can be more responsive so that even when users resize their brower the box wont get cut off.

##testing
after sending the question user will be taken back to the home section of the page.
